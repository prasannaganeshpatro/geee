		A fascination for Science & Technology and keen interest in the ever-growing world of technology motivated me to take up engineering. 

		I choose to major in Electronics and communication Engineering with an intense urge to delve into the challenging field. 

		During my under graduation program I learned the various fundamentals of Electronics and Communication Engineering which together with practical course work reinforce interest. 

		Right from my school, I had a penchant towards Mathematics, Science and research in general. 

		This basic interest led me to take up Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry as my major subjects in high school. 

		As a part of my Physics project, I had constructed logic gates and simple latches using basic circuit elements. 

		I was so astounded by the Power of Electronics and Communication. This interest made me to take Electronics and Communication Engineering. 

		I would like to present my past performance as my credentials for my success in my future endeavors. 

		My innate strength has been my quantitative and analytical abilities which instilled me a special interest for mathematical and physics. 

		I had opted the same in my 10+2 with good marks. I was placed in the top 10% of one lakh who took engineering entrance examination.

		 This performance helped me in getting admission into SRM University,Chennai,India. 

		During the course of my undergraduate study I was exposed to various courses with applications like Electric Circuits , Electromagnetic Theory and Waveguides,  Digital circuits, Digital Signal Processing, 

		Control systems , Antenna and Wave Propagation , Digital Communication, Microwave and RF Design, Optical Communication, Satellite Communication and Broadcasting and Network Security Utilization of 

		electronics and communication engineering energy enhanced my subject. 

		I secured good results in my engineering. I was well versed in programming languages like C, C++ & Java. 

		During my final year I decided to do project in ATM Security using Biometrics.
